# exon_stitching

THis program will find and stitch togetheer exons using amino acid targets and DNA assemblies

### Usage: bash exon_stitching.sh  list_of_taxa.txt  AminoAcidFile.fasta  path_to_target_assemblies/ 


You need.

1. a text file of all your taxon names
2. a fasta file of all the genes in amino acids 

the names of these files should correspond to the assembly file names.  For example atram2.0 will print out a file with the gene name followed by the taxon name and this script will look for those.
